### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™m currently learning about the intricate and multifarious lore in Tolkien's Legendarium, the world of Lord of the Rings.

Fun fact: I play violin, banjo, ukelele, mandolin, guitar, and harmonica.

Humble Brag: My highest score in bowling is 255.

Top 5 Star Wars the Clone Wars arcs: last 4 episodes of season 7 (goated)
                                     darkness on Umbara
                                     inhibitor chips (season 6)
                                     Ahsoka betrayed by the council
                                     Mortis 
                                     
Life Purpose and Meaning: To know Christ, make Him known, and help others do the same.

I am fascinated by the metaphysical implications of the intersection between storytelling and music.
